# World passport power rank, enriched edition
> Go beyond an addition of countries and discover how much of the world surface/GDP/population you can explore, visa-free!

Using a scraped copy of the Henley passport ranking, I have combined the traditional passport rank with World Bank data in order to get a more realistic view of how powerful world passports are.
Not all countries are equal in terms of surface, population, GDP.. so why passport ranks should take into account only the countries sums which weighting them ?
